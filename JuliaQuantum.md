# Why Julia?

Julia is a fast dynamic programming language 
designed for high performance and its 
multiple-dispatch feature.

### I would like to quote a short description from ForwardDiff.jl

> Unlike many other languages, Juliaâ€™s type-based operator overloading is fast and natural, and one of the central design tenets of the langauge. This is because Julia is a dynamic, JIT-compiled language - the compiled bytecode of a Julia function is tied directly to the types with which the function is called, so the compiler can optimize every Julia method for the specific input type at runtime.
